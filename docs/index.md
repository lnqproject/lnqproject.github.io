# Lymph Node Quantification (LNQ) Project

**Advancing automated analysis of lymph nodes in imaging**

---

The LNQ Project is developing new computational techniques to measure and analyze lymph nodes throughout the body. Accurate lymph node assessment is essential for cancer staging, treatment planning, and monitoring therapy response—yet current clinical practice captures only a fraction of available information.

Our goal is to enable automated 3D segmentation that can detect disease changes earlier, reduce measurement variability, and provide a more complete picture of patient status.

## What we offer

- **[Background](background.md)** — Why lymph node quantification matters and what makes it difficult.

- **[Dataset](dataset.md)** — 513 CT scans with lymph node segmentations from clinical trials, freely available under CC BY 4.0.

- **[Challenge](challenge.md)** — The LNQ2023 MICCAI Challenge—the first benchmark for weakly-supervised lymph node segmentation.

- **[Resources](resources.md)** — Data portals, publications, citation information, and funding.
