When cancer spreads, it often travels through the lymphatic system, causing nearby lymph nodes to enlarge. Measuring these nodes on CT scans is essential for staging cancer, planning treatment, and monitoring response to therapy\u2014but current clinical practice relies on simple 2D measurements of just a few nodes, missing critical information about total disease burden.</p>"},{"location":"background/#clinical-impact","title":"Clinical impact","text":"<p>Lymph node status is one of the most powerful predictors of cancer outcomes. For lung cancer, the five-year survival rate drops from 63% when the disease is localized to 35% when it has spread to regional lymph nodes. These measurements directly influence whether patients receive surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or combinations thereof. With over 2 million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year, even modest improvements in measurement accuracy could affect treatment decisions for millions of patients.</p>"},{"location":"background/#why-automated-quantification-matters","title":"Why automated quantification matters","text":"<p>Automated 3D segmentation of all enlarged lymph nodes promises to detect changes to disease earlier, reduce variability between different radiologists, and provide a more complete picture of disease status.
