# LNQ Project - Lymph Node Quantification

> Advancing automated analysis of lymph nodes in medical imaging

## Overview

The LNQ Project develops computational techniques to measure and analyze lymph nodes throughout the body. Accurate lymph node assessment is essential for cancer staging, treatment planning, and monitoring therapy response. Current clinical practice captures only a fraction of available information through simple 2D measurements.

The project provides:
- Public datasets of CT scans with lymph node segmentations
- The LNQ2023 MICCAI Challenge benchmark for weakly-supervised segmentation
- Research publications on automated lymph node quantification
